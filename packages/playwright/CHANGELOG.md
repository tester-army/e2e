# @e2edev/playwright

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- [#239](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/239) [`5b6f594`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/5b6f5947a5e64a1cbb3575d3a9424afdcbb0b2e2) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - A node an exact label query or a display-value query found is pinned to its
  element. Such a match is one candidate among many (every labelable control,
  every input with a value), and its ref used to re-resolve by position when the
  action ran, so a page that inserted or removed an element in between made the
  action land on a neighbor: a `fill` on a "Project Name" field hit a button
  and failed as "not an input". The handles are taken first and the semantics
  are read from those very handles, so what was read and what is acted on are
  one set of elements. Handles that did not match are released at once, and a
  located element ref is released when the registry prunes or clears it, so a
  long attempt no longer accumulates browser objects.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#226](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/226) [`adbc92c`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/adbc92c928c6d1d28e65773ccbe58876f4de14a4) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Both engines declare their platform on the handle: `web` for playwright, the
  `platform` option for agent-device. A target that names them no longer has to
  repeat it. Both engines now require `@e2edev/e2e` 0.8 or newer (peer range
  `>=0.8.0 <1`): an older runner rejects `platform` as an unknown engine key,
  and could still send `states.hidden` in a role query, which these engines no
  longer read.

- [#233](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/233) [`a659f5f`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/a659f5f5fcfc0fa97b5b460fa595d8bbf558cd0a) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Video recording. With `artifacts: ['video']` or `--video`, the engine screencasts the attempt's page to `video/video.webm` at the attempt's viewport size, one segment per page: a restart or a state reset opens a new page and continues in `video/video-part<n>.webm`.

- [#225](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/225) [`47be7f8`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/47be7f867da427cfa05f999c9af32ed5fd6eb6ba) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - `SelectOption` on the engine contract gains a `{ value }` variant. Playwright
  selects by the option's `value` attribute; the device engine's `selectOption`
  stays `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY` for every variant.

### Patch Changes

- [#234](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/234) [`7d4ca98`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/7d4ca981917114ad5f5955805fea7b235d6e932b) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - A control's name and its labels no longer include text marked `aria-hidden`.
  A required field whose label ends in a hidden asterisk was named
  `"Display name*"`, so `getByLabel('Display name')` and `getByRole('textbox',
{ name: 'Display name' })` found nothing while every screen reader said
  "Display name". Names follow the accessible name computation: aria-hidden
  subtrees are dropped, CSS-hidden ones stay out as before, and hidden text
  between visible fragments is skipped too. Screen text is untouched:
  `getByText('Display name*')` still finds the label, and a node's `text` still
  reads as a person sees it. An exact label query is now decided by the engine
  over every labelable element in scope (button, input, meter, output, progress,
  select, textarea, and anything with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`),
  matching any of the element's labels (an `aria-label`, an `aria-labelledby`
  target, or an associated `<label>`) the way Playwright's `getByLabel` does; as
  a scope or `has` filter it composes through Playwright's substring label match.

- [#223](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/223) [`68620ef`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/68620ef7459739f89f7846decd54af1c8e5105e9) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Role queries no longer read a `hidden` state from the query: the engine
  contract dropped it. Playwright's role locator keeps its default of matching
  only nodes exposed to assistive technology; the device engine skips hidden
  nodes in role queries as it did by default.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#194](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/194) [`d9ecd33`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/d9ecd338d8f7c34f79395c874c2f975fe55094eb) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Both engines now require `@e2edev/e2e` 0.5.0 or newer. They import
  `@e2edev/e2e/engine`, which 0.5.0 introduced (0.4.x shipped `/backend`), so
  the old `>=0.4.0` range allowed an install whose every import failed.

- [#205](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/205) [`76aaeb1`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/76aaeb16b642c12d8a6f4dfb3d899a579b814e44) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Release observation metadata after each capture so repeated agent observations do not retain earlier node arrays in the browser.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#175](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/175) [`766cf52`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/766cf52c0db44be69d05079fa4f97726c3e5fa15) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Node.js 22.12 is the floor. Node 20 reached end of life in April 2026; the
  `engines` field, the CLI's startup check, and the docs now all say 22.12.

- [#167](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/167) [`bbe8420`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/bbe842042737f5df92766628429e5eb1cf67239f) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Add `toBeFocused` and `toHaveAttribute` locator matchers, and make `getAttribute` read any attribute present on the element.
  Add `expect(web).toHaveClass(target, expected)` to the web fixture.

### Patch Changes

- [#161](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/161) [`41612dc`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/41612dcf44e6e395d578a23c09cf1dd451231095) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Package and CLI descriptions no longer call e2e a "standard".

- [#168](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/168) [`1ef5b00`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/1ef5b003b62a588f554ad567f9d1f4540ffd8b35) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - READMEs and CLI help use the scoped package names (`@e2edev/e2e`,
  `@e2edev/playwright`, `@e2edev/agent-device`) on every install line, point at
  the Fern docs instead of e2e.dev, and describe e2e as an open framework for
  agentic end-to-end testing.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#154](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/154) [`1d352b3`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/1d352b3ee98a02d239c95e4055b4bb5219d7edfc) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - The app under test is declared by the engine that drives it, not by the
  config. The top-level `app` key (`url`, `command`, `readyUrl`, `services`,
  `allowedOrigins`, `environment`, `identity`) is gone, and so is the runner's
  `APP_URL` fallback: the browser engine takes the same fields as options,
  `playwright({ url, command, services, ... })`, and the device engine derives
  the identity from the app it pins (`agentDevice({ platform, app })`, or an
  explicit `identity`). Two web targets on one app each name it; services and
  commands declared identically by several targets start once.

  For engine authors, the `app` manifest of `defineEngine` carries the
  declaration (`EngineAppDeclaration`) beside its hooks, and the runner
  resolves it per target: navigation policy, cache and session identity, the
  report's target record (`baseOrigin` is now absent for a surface without a
  URL), and the app process all read from there. A device target can finally
  declare a stable identity without inventing a URL. `@e2edev/e2e/engine` also
  exports `obj`, the one-call replacement for the conditional-spread
  idiom when a declaration is built from optional inputs.

  Migrate by moving the `app` block into the engine factory:

  ```ts
  // before
  app: { url: 'http://localhost:3000' },
  targets: [{ name: 'web', platform: 'web', engine: playwright() }],
  // after
  targets: [{ name: 'web', platform: 'web', engine: playwright({ url: 'http://localhost:3000' }) }],
  ```

- [#154](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/154) [`1d352b3`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/1d352b3ee98a02d239c95e4055b4bb5219d7edfc) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Rename the "backend" concept to "engine" everywhere. The authoring import is now `@e2edev/e2e/engine` (`defineEngine`, `EngineHandle`, `EngineError`, `EngineFixtureContext`, ...), a target names its engine as `engine: playwright()` in `e2e.config.ts`, the error code `BACKEND_FAILURE` is now `ENGINE_FAILURE`, and the `backend` provenance field in the report and session schemas is now `engine`. `@e2edev/e2e/backend`, `defineBackend`, `backend:` and `BACKEND_FAILURE` are gone; update the import path, the config key, and any code matching on the error code or reading provenance.

### Patch Changes

- [#145](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/145) [`24a5763`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/24a5763e8bf234d481778d19f420f83335cc6e48) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - `getByDisplayValue(...)` now supports `first()`, `last()`, `nth()`, and `filter({ hasText, has })` in the playwright engine, so a display-value locator can be narrowed, acted on, and asserted like every other query. Positions apply to the value-filtered matches, not to every form control on the page. Previously any refinement failed with `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY: displayValue queries cannot be used as scopes or filters in this engine`. The two compositions Playwright's locator chain cannot express remain unsupported and now say so precisely: a display-value query as the scope of a child query, and as a `has` filter.

- [#149](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/149) [`f810e23`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/f810e2324b02b189cbbb6242a55da5d587285932) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Every `screen` query accepts `visible: true`, which drops nodes the platform reports as hidden before the exactly-one rule runs: `getByText('No memories yet', { visible: true })` resolves the copy a person sees even while a framework keeps a `display:none` twin in the document after a reload. Omitted or `false` keeps every match, so existing `LOCATOR_AMBIGUOUS` failures still fire. The predicate is the node's own `hidden` state, the one `toBeVisible()` reads, and it composes with scopes, `filter`, `first`, `last`, and `nth`. `getByTestId` gains the same optional `{ visible }` argument.

  The engine contract's `SemanticQuery` carries the flag as `visible`; the Playwright and agent-device engines evaluate it from the hidden state they already report, and the harness holds a top-level query to the same predicate as a backstop.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#133](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/133) [`d14a79c`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/d14a79c0420e25a2db9244bff4e107af42395a04) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - `surfaceOf(handle)` exposes the live `Page` and `BrowserContext` behind a
  `playwright()` handle to agent-side code, the way `@e2edev/agent-device`
  exposes its device surface. A step executor that replaces the toolset
  wholesale can now drive the page e2e itself opened, instead of attaching a
  second browser it cannot reach. Both accessors read the current attempt and
  throw `INVALID_STATE` before it exists; the harness remains the notary for
  what it witnesses, and a caller here acts out of band.

### Patch Changes

- [#131](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/131) [`04f4a43`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/04f4a43574c65dbb6b1cdb406da569727f56368c) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - An exception thrown by the page inside `web.evaluate` is now a test failure,
  `EVALUATE_FAILED`, carrying the page's own message, as the spec's evaluation
  rules describe. It was reported as infrastructure (`BACKEND_FAILURE`, exit
  code 3) with Playwright's call prefix in front of the message, so a script
  that failed a check read like a broken browser. A page-side result envelope
  distinguishes these exceptions from transport failures. Timeouts, page and
  browser closure, crashes, protocol failures, and a document lost to navigation
  keep their infrastructure classification.

- [#129](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/129) [`c4b74ee`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/c4b74ee4fdbbd00bc919a4b287250c5f0e2234f3) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Replace the keyed browser pool with a single shared connection per worker, preserving reconnect and in-flight launch cleanup.

- [#132](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/132) [`bc87f15`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/bc87f15b3b62258f8e9c059873e1f89a67ba27de) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Keep secret redaction and pixel taint with the live session across serial members. Route device model screenshots through guarded observations and reserve project-tool action budgets before dispatch, serializing mutations with grammar actions.

  Add explicit fixture operation declarations, preserve legacy factories, mark contributed assertions as verification steps, and isolate asynchronous step attribution. Share cancellation helpers; deprecate optional tool annotations whose replay and secret semantics are not implemented.

  Preserve fixture object identity and mutable state when recording declared operations, and retain artifacts and viewport metadata attached before a legacy synchronous failure.

  Bound device located references and reuse snapshot location metadata. Both reference backends require e2e >=0.4.0 for the new fixture and lifecycle helpers.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#115](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/115) [`b08a668`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/b08a668eed39e3d68b5f5d15335eef9895bdb15f) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Backends get a `prepare` hook: once per run and target, in the runner process,
  before any worker starts and outside every launch budget. The Playwright
  backend installs a missing browser there instead of inside `init`, so a
  first-run download is no longer charged against `launchTimeout`, no longer runs
  once per worker, and its progress streams as new `notice` run events. The list
  reporter prints those above its live status block, where before the block's
  repaint erased the download output written to a worker's stderr and a first run
  looked hung on a spinner.

- [#113](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/113) [`6a2918c`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/6a2918cf98117d5c06a815422498923ee2c1c043) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Observation node ids are stable per element: the reader stamps an id on each
  element the first time it is observed and reads it back afterwards, so an
  element keeps its id across observations for as long as it lives in the
  document, and an executor can diff two observations instead of re-reading
  the screen. Closed `<select>` controls list their options (up to 60) as child
  nodes. Table rows and cells are observed as `row`, `cell`, and
  `columnheader` nodes instead of being flattened into their text and buttons,
  so a control inside a row can be told apart from the same control in the
  next row.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#114](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/114) [`e19b826`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/e19b826a7f2a944122099851803f6961f107cf86) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Publish under the `@e2edev` npm scope as restricted (private) packages: the core package `e2e` is now `@e2edev/e2e`, beside `@e2edev/playwright` and `@e2edev/agent-device`. Entry points move with the name (`@e2edev/e2e/agent`, `@e2edev/e2e/backend`, `@e2edev/e2e/run`); the `e2e` CLI binary keeps its name. Provenance is off while the packages are private, since npm only attests public packages.

- [#101](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/101) [`8c97039`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/8c9703906c476af6dea063c44ddc179399b102e5) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - **Breaking.** Playwright is a backend, and core knows no platform (RFC0002
  step 2'). The bumps stay `minor` under the 0.x policy, but the shapes below
  are removed or changed and a project upgrading must migrate its config and any
  backend it wrote.

  Removed:

  - `@e2edev/e2e/driver`, `defineDriver`, and every driver-SPI type; the `driver:` and
    `browser:` target keys; the top-level `browser` config key; the implicit
    zero-config web target. `targets` is required and a target is
    `{ name, platform, backend? }`.
  - The `actions` verb object on a backend (`actions: { tap, type, press,
select, scroll, navigate, back }`). Every node action is now
    `perform(ref, action, context)` taking one `LocatorAction`; viewport scroll
    is `swipe(direction, momentum, context)`; `navigate` and `back` live under
    `app: { navigate?, back?, restart?, clearState? }`. The `actions` capability
    means `perform` is declared, and the agent offers the model only the verbs
    the backend declares.
  - `artifacts: ['video']` is no longer accepted in config, and `video` is gone
    from the report's `artifactCapabilities` (a fixture may still attach a
    `video` artifact).
  - `DRIVER_FAILURE` is now `BACKEND_FAILURE`.

  Changed:

  - `Backend.version` is required (a non-empty string): it is provenance and
    keys the trace cache.
  - `endAttempt(context)` and `dispose(context)` receive a
    `BackendCleanupContext` (`{ signal, timeoutMs }`) whose `signal` aborts when
    the cleanup budget is spent. `dispose` runs whether or not `init` ran, and
    `init` may run again after `dispose` on the same handle.
  - `defineBackend` validates the nested `state`, `artifacts`, and `app`
    manifests (closed keys, function members), binds every method so a class
    instance is a valid body, and rejects unknown nested keys with
    `INVALID_CONFIG`.
  - `BackendInitInfo.app.baseUrl` and `BackendFixtureContext.app.baseUrl` are
    optional; absent when no app URL is configured.
  - `Web`, `WebRoute`, `WebResponse`, `RouteFulfillResponse`, `Cookie`,
    `Dialog`, and `WebExpectation` moved out of `e2e` into `@e2edev/playwright`.
    `expect(fixture)` routes to whatever expectation surface a backend attaches
    through `BackendFixtureContext.expectable`. Every `web` method call,
    including `url()`, `title()`, and `cookies()`, is now a recorded step.
  - Reports and session envelopes record `backend: { name, version, spiVersion }`
    instead of `driver`, drop `browser`/`browserVersion`/`viewport` from target
    provenance, and step events use kind `backend` (spec `suiteVersion` 0.6.0).

  Added:

  - `@e2edev/playwright` exports `playwright(options)`: a `defineBackend` handle
    with observation, actions, location, state, artifacts, and the contributed
    `web` fixture. `browser` and `viewport` are its options. It also exports
    `test` typed with `web`; `expect` and `credentials` still come from `e2e`.
  - `@e2edev/e2e/backend` exports `BACKEND_ERROR_CODES` and
    `RETRYABLE_BACKEND_ERROR_CODES` (`NODE_STALE`, `FRAME_NOT_FOUND`).
  - `@e2edev/e2e/backend` exports the semantics the spec requires every backend to
    reproduce exactly: `TestError`, `ConfigurationError`, `InfrastructureError`,
    `matchesText`, `toTextPattern`, `describePattern`, `urlMatches`,
    `pollCondition`, `Deadline`, and `validateJsonValue`. The `@e2edev/e2e/internal`
    subpath is removed; a backend package depends on `@e2edev/e2e/backend` only.
  - `defineTool` accepts `platforms` to scope a tool pack to targets by
    platform, and `StepExecutorContext.target` names the target a step runs on.

  Migration:

  ```ts
  // before
  export default defineConfig({
    browser: "chromium",
    targets: [{ name: "web", platform: "web", driver: "playwright" }],
  });

  // after
  import { playwright } from "@e2edev/playwright";

  export default defineConfig({
    targets: [
      {
        name: "web",
        platform: "web",
        backend: playwright({ browser: "chromium" }),
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

  A backend written against the earlier `@e2edev/e2e/backend` draft moves its `actions`
  verbs onto `perform` (switch on `action.kind`), its viewport `scroll` onto
  `swipe`, its `navigate`/`back` under `app`, declares `version`, and accepts
  the cleanup context on `endAttempt`/`dispose`.

- [#105](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/105) [`f64b191`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/f64b1917d3f87b84e83e7475ec9368068fc7b3ec) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - `playwright({ connect })` attaches to a remote browser over the Chrome DevTools
  Protocol instead of launching a local one. `connect.cdpEndpoint` is an async
  resolver called at worker init, and again on any reconnect, so a hosted browser
  whose endpoint is provisioned per run — a cloud session URL not known at config
  load — resolves each time the pool needs it. CDP attach is chromium-only (the
  factory rejects another engine as `INVALID_CONFIG`), a local launch skips the
  browser-install step it no longer needs, and disposing the backend detaches the
  CDP session without killing the remote process the host owns.

- [#20](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/20) [`1e21658`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/1e21658c949900be0191221a468647e43b6ddf2a) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Move the Playwright driver into its own `@e2edev/playwright` package.

  `e2e` no longer depends on `playwright`, so installs that drive another backend
  no longer download a browser. `driver: 'playwright'` still works and is still
  the default for web targets; the runner now loads the driver from
  `@e2edev/playwright`, which it declares as an optional peer dependency.

  **Upgrading:** install the driver alongside the runner.

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev @e2edev/e2e @e2edev/playwright
  ```

  A target that names the driver without the package installed now fails config
  resolution with `DRIVER_NOT_INSTALLED` and exit code 2, naming the package to
  install.

  Also in this release:

  - Drivers can implement an optional `prepare` hook, run once before any session
    launches, for slow one-time provisioning. Browser downloads now happen there,
    so they are never charged against a launch timeout for any driver, not just
    the built-in one. A failing `prepare` aborts the run as an infrastructure
    error instead of a test failure.
  - The list reporter now prints run-level errors. Previously a run that failed
    during config, collection, or provisioning exited non-zero with the reason
    only in `report.json`.
  - The `e2e/playwright` subpath export is removed; import from
    `@e2edev/playwright` instead.

- [#78](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/78) [`61b31dd`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/61b31dd95e431804e5bdb17a37da325d4dca10ef) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Locate nodes that no query can name, and observe shadow roots and `data:` frames.

  An agent step whose target has no accessible name, test id, placeholder, or text
  used to fail with `LOCATOR_NOT_FOUND` before it looked at the page. The model had
  already selected the right node; the runner discarded it because no portable
  query could be derived from it — so the agent tier failed hardest on exactly the
  controls that have no deterministic address either, such as an input whose label
  is the table cell beside it.

  The locate sweep now falls through to the two paths that need no query:

  - the node's **observed reference**, which the driver backs with the element
    itself, and
  - the driver's **platform selector** for the node when it has an anchored one, in
    which case the located node carries a real locator instead of a reference and
    so survives into the cache and into `dragTo`. Recorded as the
    `locate.selector` policy decision.

  Both paths re-read the live node and require its recorded identity before acting,
  exactly as replay does, so a stale selection is still a miss rather than a blind
  dispatch. `poll: false` callers keep their early exit for escalation.

  One observation gap closes alongside it in `@e2edev/playwright`: **open shadow
  roots are walked**, so a control that exists only in a shadow tree is now
  selectable. Slotted content is not double-counted — slotted elements are
  light-DOM children, and the shadow tree holds `<slot>` placeholders rather than
  copies. A closed root stays invisible, as it is to a person reading the page.

  Empty painted rectangles are observed, and a drag can end on one.

  A drop zone, a colour swatch, a chart placeholder: an element defined by being
  empty carries no role, name, text, or test id, so the observation walk skipped it
  and no instruction could name it. An empty element that paints something — a
  border, an outline, a background of its own — and is at least 12 CSS pixels on
  each side is now reported with the role `box`. Nothing else changes: an unpainted
  spacer of the same size is still omitted, because a person cannot see it either.

  `dragTo` also no longer requires a locator on both sides. `Locator.dragTo` takes
  two locators, so a destination the agent reached through its observed reference
  made the whole verb unavailable — exactly for the elements that have no locator.
  When either endpoint is reference-backed the driver drives the pointer instead,
  which is also what makes HTML5 drag-and-drop commit, since it needs a real
  `dragover`. A drag whose _source_ is reference-only still fails: `dragTo` locates
  twice and every observation disposes the generation before it, so the source
  handle does not survive to the dispatch. That is an observation lifecycle
  question, not a drag one.

### Patch Changes

- [#86](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/86) [`347aa7d`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/347aa7ded66fd774ffe859399a3c030cd405df3b) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - `agent.act()` ships on a harness-owned step-executor socket (RFC0001 v0).

  The harness owns each planned step — observation redaction, the action
  grammar (`tap`, `type`, `typeSecret`, `press`, `select`, `scroll`,
  `navigate`), budgets, deadlines, origin policy, and recording — and delegates
  only the thinking to a pluggable `StepExecutor`, configured as the `agent`
  value itself: `agent: createAgent({...})` or any hand-rolled executor (there
  is no `executor` key). The `@e2edev/e2e/agent` entrypoint exports `createAgent` (the
  built-in AI SDK tool-loop executor), `createToolLoopExecutor` (the chassis:
  verdict tool, hard stops, loop guards, wind-down, `--debug` transcripts), and
  `defineTool` for annotated project tools. Verdicts are ternary: `blocked` is first-class
  in the report (step and run status) with a closed category taxonomy
  (credentials, environment, seed_data, test_setup, automation). `Secret`
  values flow into `act` params as placeholders and fill only through the
  authorized `typeSecret` action. With a custom executor, `agent.assert` also
  dispatches through the socket.

  Breaking changes:

  - The AI SDK (`ai`) is now an optional peer dependency (`^7.0.0`) instead of
    a hard dependency. Model-backed calls require it installed; deterministic
    suites and custom executors run without it.
  - `reporters` accepts only `'list' | 'json'` (the unimplemented `'html'`
    value is removed) and defaults to `['list']`.
  - The `limits` block accepts only enforced keys; the ten
    validated-but-unenforced keys (`maxDiscoveredResults`, `maxArtifactBytes`,
    `maxArtifactTotalBytes`, `maxDownloadBytes`, `maxDownloads`,
    `maxReportBytes`, `maxTerminalFieldBytes`, `maxModelCallsPerStep`,
    `maxActionStepsPerStep`, `maxEstimatedCostUsd`) are rejected.
  - `report-1` documents changed (limits/usage blocks, `blocked` statuses, new
    error codes); the conformance `suiteVersion` is now 0.2.0.
  - `verifyDriver` and its conformance types are removed from `@e2edev/e2e/driver`
    until the harness can actually run vectors.

- [#107](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/107) [`e0ac8af`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/e0ac8af5ca2247eef0962945b7500efede1bbb8d) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Observation and lifecycle hardening in the browser backend:

  - One deadline bounds a whole observation: settling, the main document, every
    same-origin iframe, and the pixels each spend from what remains, so nested
    frames can no longer stretch one `observe` past the operation budget.
  - An observation cancelled by the harness no longer publishes its handle
    generation over the one the caller still holds refs into.
  - `locate` no longer derives a CSS selector for every matched element on every
    assertion poll; nothing consumed it. The tree walk memoizes role, name, and
    direct text per element and reuses the computed style it already holds, and
    each document is read with one fewer protocol round trip.
  - A function dialog handler that returns without calling `accept` or `dismiss`
    now has the dialog dismissed and fails the next step with `INVALID_STATE`
    instead of leaving the page blocked behind it.
  - A first-run browser download and the browser launch honour the init signal.
  - A trace segment that cannot be written during `clearState` or session
    restore is best-effort and can no longer leave the surface on the old context.

- [#79](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/79) [`bc0f377`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/bc0f377a0a2b5c9e9cea5cfffbcf94a1e8dcd7ae) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Harden the boundary between the runner and an out-of-tree driver.

  A driver's `DriverError` is now recognized structurally rather than with
  `instanceof`. A driver imported by a config file resolves through a different
  module registry than the runner, so the two hold different copies of the class
  and `instanceof` misses. Every typed driver failure then lost its taxonomy: a
  retryable `NODE_STALE` stopped being retried and surfaced as a generic failure
  instead of a recoverable race. This affects any driver package, including
  `@e2edev/playwright` whenever a project ends up with more than one copy of
  `e2e` resolved.

  Builds now clear `dist` before compiling. `tsc` only writes files, so output
  whose source has since moved or been deleted survived every later build and was
  published: after the Playwright driver moved out of `e2e`, the `e2e` tarball
  still carried a full copy of the old `dist/playwright` tree.

- [#107](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/107) [`e0ac8af`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/e0ac8af5ca2247eef0962945b7500efede1bbb8d) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Correctness and speed fixes across the runner's support layers:

  - `agent.act` params and `web.evaluate` values that reach the same object by
    two paths are no longer rejected as cycles.
  - A setup test filtered out by its own `platforms` list can no longer be
    promoted to run on a target it excluded; a consumer that needs it is a
    collection error, as for a missing capability.
  - Trace start and end paths pass the secret redactor before they are written;
    a redacted path marks the trace non-replayable. The start-path precondition
    now compares by pathname like the end postcondition, so a differing query
    string no longer cold-misses the cache.
  - Negated assertions with a budget shorter than the one-second grace window
    can pass again; `toHaveCount` polls within its assertion deadline.
  - Replay relocation projects each observed node once per observation instead
    of once per recorded action per tier; wire regexps are compiled once; text
    sanitizing and UTF-8 truncation are single-pass; value matchers format
    failure messages only on failure; test discovery skips dot-directories.
  - Dead code removed: the unused `internal/backend-text` module, the unused
    `selectorExpression`, and several exports that had no consumer.

- [#74](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/74) [`9334e8f`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/9334e8f35cbaacbe61b10b3489ea87a920aeb99a) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Ship package metadata for the registry: repository, homepage, bug tracker,
  keywords, and the MIT `LICENSE` file. Releases publish under the `beta`
  dist-tag while the surface stabilizes, so `latest` is not moved.

- [#107](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/107) [`e0ac8af`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/e0ac8af5ca2247eef0962945b7500efede1bbb8d) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - `web.route` registers on the browser context, not the current page: a route
  now applies before the first page opens, to popups, and across `app.restart()`,
  `app.clearState()`, and session restore, as the attempt-scoped contract in the
  spec requires. Previously a stub silently stopped firing after any of those.
