# @e2edev/playwright

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/20) [`1e21658`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/1e21658c949900be0191221a468647e43b6ddf2a) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Move the Playwright driver into its own `@e2edev/playwright` package.

  `e2e` no longer depends on `playwright`, so installs that drive another backend
  no longer download a browser. `driver: 'playwright'` still works and is still
  the default for web targets; the runner now loads the driver from
  `@e2edev/playwright`, which it declares as an optional peer dependency.

  **Upgrading:** install the driver alongside the runner.

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev e2e @e2edev/playwright
  ```

  A target that names the driver without the package installed now fails config
  resolution with `DRIVER_NOT_INSTALLED` and exit code 2, naming the package to
  install.

  Also in this release:

  - Drivers can implement an optional `prepare` hook, run once before any session
    launches, for slow one-time provisioning. Browser downloads now happen there,
    so they are never charged against a launch timeout for any driver, not just
    the built-in one. A failing `prepare` aborts the run as an infrastructure
    error instead of a test failure.
  - The list reporter now prints run-level errors. Previously a run that failed
    during config, collection, or provisioning exited non-zero with the reason
    only in `report.json`.
  - The `e2e/playwright` subpath export is removed; import from
    `@e2edev/playwright` instead.

- [#78](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/78) [`61b31dd`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/61b31dd95e431804e5bdb17a37da325d4dca10ef) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Locate nodes that no query can name, and observe shadow roots and `data:` frames.

  An agent step whose target has no accessible name, test id, placeholder, or text
  used to fail with `LOCATOR_NOT_FOUND` before it looked at the page. The model had
  already selected the right node; the runner discarded it because no portable
  query could be derived from it — so the agent tier failed hardest on exactly the
  controls that have no deterministic address either, such as an input whose label
  is the table cell beside it.

  The locate sweep now falls through to the two paths that need no query:

  - the node's **observed reference**, which the driver backs with the element
    itself, and
  - the driver's **platform selector** for the node when it has an anchored one, in
    which case the located node carries a real locator instead of a reference and
    so survives into the cache and into `dragTo`. Recorded as the
    `locate.selector` policy decision.

  Both paths re-read the live node and require its recorded identity before acting,
  exactly as replay does, so a stale selection is still a miss rather than a blind
  dispatch. `poll: false` callers keep their early exit for escalation.

  One observation gap closes alongside it in `@e2edev/playwright`: **open shadow
  roots are walked**, so a control that exists only in a shadow tree is now
  selectable. Slotted content is not double-counted — slotted elements are
  light-DOM children, and the shadow tree holds `<slot>` placeholders rather than
  copies. A closed root stays invisible, as it is to a person reading the page.

  Empty painted rectangles are observed, and a drag can end on one.

  A drop zone, a colour swatch, a chart placeholder: an element defined by being
  empty carries no role, name, text, or test id, so the observation walk skipped it
  and no instruction could name it. An empty element that paints something — a
  border, an outline, a background of its own — and is at least 12 CSS pixels on
  each side is now reported with the role `box`. Nothing else changes: an unpainted
  spacer of the same size is still omitted, because a person cannot see it either.

  `dragTo` also no longer requires a locator on both sides. `Locator.dragTo` takes
  two locators, so a destination the agent reached through its observed reference
  made the whole verb unavailable — exactly for the elements that have no locator.
  When either endpoint is reference-backed the driver drives the pointer instead,
  which is also what makes HTML5 drag-and-drop commit, since it needs a real
  `dragover`. A drag whose _source_ is reference-only still fails: `dragTo` locates
  twice and every observation disposes the generation before it, so the source
  handle does not survive to the dispatch. That is an observation lifecycle
  question, not a drag one.

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/79) [`bc0f377`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/bc0f377a0a2b5c9e9cea5cfffbcf94a1e8dcd7ae) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Harden the boundary between the runner and an out-of-tree driver.

  A driver's `DriverError` is now recognized structurally rather than with
  `instanceof`. A driver imported by a config file resolves through a different
  module registry than the runner, so the two hold different copies of the class
  and `instanceof` misses. Every typed driver failure then lost its taxonomy: a
  retryable `NODE_STALE` stopped being retried and surfaced as a generic failure
  instead of a recoverable race. This affects any driver package, including
  `@e2edev/playwright` whenever a project ends up with more than one copy of
  `e2e` resolved.

  Builds now clear `dist` before compiling. `tsc` only writes files, so output
  whose source has since moved or been deleted survived every later build and was
  published: after the Playwright driver moved out of `e2e`, the `e2e` tarball
  still carried a full copy of the old `dist/playwright` tree.

  `e2e/internal` additionally shares `causeMessage` and `sanitizeFilename`, the
  two text helpers each driver package would otherwise reimplement. Backend
  messages and artifact labels reach reports, so stripping terminal control
  sequences and constraining filenames happen in one place rather than once per
  driver.

  keywords, and the MIT `LICENSE` file. Releases publish under the `beta`
  dist-tag while the surface stabilizes, so `latest` is not moved.
