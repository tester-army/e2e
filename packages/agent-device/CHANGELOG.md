# @e2edev/agent-device

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#117](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/117) [`44ce280`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/44ce280e92772b452b6a958bf1a606b43e7cdba3) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Install builds on the device. The `appPath` backend option installs an iOS
  `.app` bundle or Android `.apk` once per worker, after boot and before the
  first attempt; without `app`, the installed bundle id or package becomes the
  app opened fresh per attempt, so `agentDevice({ platform: 'ios', appPath:
'./build/MyApp.app' })` is a complete target. The `device` fixture gains
  `installApp(appPath, { app, reinstall })` for tests that exercise upgrade or
  fresh-install paths, recorded as a `device.installApp` step.

  `BackendInitInfo` carries `projectRoot`, the directory relative config paths
  resolve against, so a backend option naming a file resolves the same way in a
  child-process worker and an in-process run.

### Patch Changes

- [#119](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/119) [`00cfc52`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/00cfc52bd5a9ab56f7fb2dad357ce325c9ce4817) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Hooks now run in the order the lifecycle spec defines. `beforeEach` runs outer
  scope to inner and `afterEach` inner to outer regardless of where in the file
  each scope's hooks were declared; before, a file-level hook declared below a
  `test.describe` ran after (or, for `afterEach`, before) the group's own hooks.
  A `describe`'s `afterAll` runs when its last test in the realm finishes rather
  than when the whole file ends, so one group's teardown no longer lands after a
  sibling group's tests. Sibling groups that share a title keep separate hooks.
  A failing `afterAll` discards the realm as the spec requires: later tests start
  fresh, and a serial group attempt ends with its remaining members skipped.

  Each `afterEach` hook gets its own `cleanupTimeout` budget with working
  fixtures: after a body timeout, teardown can still drive the app instead of
  failing with `operation cancelled`; a hook that overruns its budget fails, its
  fixture operations are cancelled, and the next hook still runs. The agent-device
  `device` fixture reads that signal per call, so it too keeps working in teardown.

  Suite-hook run errors carry a readable `scopeId` (`file` or the group title
  path); an `afterAll` failure at file scope no longer writes an empty
  `scopeId` the report schema rejects.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#102](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/102) [`e3300c4`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/e3300c4b420ea7a5a7e3ee15480a1e38bd1a133b) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - New package: `@e2edev/agent-device`, the mobile backend for `e2e`, built on
  [agent-device](https://github.com/callstack/agent-device). It implements the
  public `@e2edev/e2e/backend` contract for iOS simulators and Android emulators the
  same way `@e2edev/playwright` does for browsers, and core learns nothing new.

  - `agentDevice({ platform, app?, device?, session?, snapshot? })` returns a
    `defineBackend` handle with observation (the accessibility tree projected
    onto the role vocabulary, with a viewport and optional pixels), actions
    (tap, double tap, long press, fill, clear, check, Enter, single-character
    keys, node swipe, drag), location (every `screen` query plus agent-device
    selectors through `screen.locator`), a viewport swipe, `app.back`, and
    `app.restart`/`app.clearState` when `app` is pinned. Screenshots land under
    the attempt artifact directory.
  - Trace cache support: the backend reports a location as
    `app://device/<app>/<screen title>`, so `agent.act` steps record a start and
    end anchor and replay zero-turn on the next run like a web step does.
    Screenshots and observation pixels have every secure field painted over;
    an image that cannot be redacted is withheld. With `app` pinned, the app
    is opened fresh per attempt and a flow needs no agent-side tool at all.
  - The contributed `device` fixture: network, airplane mode, permissions,
    location, appearance, orientation, biometrics, open/close app, foreground
    app, home, back, alerts, keyboard, clipboard. Import `test` from the
    package to have it typed.
  - `@e2edev/agent-device/tools` exports `agentDeviceTools(...backends)`: an
    `open_app`, `swipe`, `type_text`, `alert`, and `screenshot` pack for
    `createAgent`, scoped to the platforms of the backends passed and
    dispatching to the one whose attempt is running, so one pack serves an iOS
    and an Android target in the same config.

- [#114](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/pull/114) [`e19b826`](https://github.com/tester-army/e2e/commit/e19b826a7f2a944122099851803f6961f107cf86) Thanks [@okwasniewski](https://github.com/okwasniewski)! - Publish under the `@e2edev` npm scope as restricted (private) packages: the core package `e2e` is now `@e2edev/e2e`, beside `@e2edev/playwright` and `@e2edev/agent-device`. Entry points move with the name (`@e2edev/e2e/agent`, `@e2edev/e2e/backend`, `@e2edev/e2e/run`); the `e2e` CLI binary keeps its name. Provenance is off while the packages are private, since npm only attests public packages.
