Rename the "backend" concept to "engine" everywhere. The authoring import is now `@e2edev/e2e/engine` (`defineEngine`, `EngineHandle`, `EngineError`, `EngineFixtureContext`, ...), a target names its engine as `engine: playwright()` in `e2e.config.ts`, the error code `BACKEND_FAILURE` is now `ENGINE_FAILURE`, and the `backend` provenance field in the report and session schemas is now `engine`. `@e2edev/e2e/backend`, `defineBackend`, `backend:` and `BACKEND_FAILURE` are gone; update the import path, the config key, and any code matching on the error code or reading provenance.
