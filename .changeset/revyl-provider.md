'@e2e-dev/revyl': patch
---

Add `@e2e-dev/revyl`: `revyl({ app, device, osVersion })` runs mobile targets on Revyl's hosted iOS simulators and Android emulators, one device per worker slot, through agent-device's `@agent-device/revyl` plugin. Set `REVYL_API_KEY` in the run environment; Revyl installs the build from the `https` `app` URL.
