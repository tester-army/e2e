"@e2e-dev/notte": patch

New package: `notte()`, a browser provider that runs each test attempt in its own [Notte](https://notte.cc) cloud browser session, stops it when the attempt ends, reads `browser.waitForDownload` files back from the session's storage, and stops the sessions of workers that died when the run ends. [Notte browsers](https://e2e.com/docs/integrations/notte)
